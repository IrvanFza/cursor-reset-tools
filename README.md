A modern web-based tool to reset Cursor IDE's Machine ID, helping users to bypass trial limitations and continue using Cursor AI capabilities.

## Advanced Bypass Features

- **Pro Trial Conversion**: Access Pro features without purchasing a subscription
- **Machine ID Reset**: Bypass the "Too many free trial accounts used on this machine" limitation
- **Auto Update Prevention**: Stop Cursor from updating and potentially removing bypass functionality
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, modern UI with clear instructions
- **System Information**: Displays detailed system and Cursor installation info

## How it Works

Cursor identifies your machine using a unique ID stored in specific locations:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\machineId`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/machineId`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/cursor/machineid`

This tool:
1. Detects if Cursor is running (and warns you to close it)
2. Generates a new UUID to replace your existing machine ID
3. Clears cached files that store your usage data
4. Prevents automatic updates that could remove bypass functionality
5. Modifies system files to unlock Pro features and bypass token limits
6. Allows Cursor to treat your machine as a new device

## üí° Recommended Tips

- Use private/incognito browser window for registration
- Clear browser cookies after registration

## Technologies Used
